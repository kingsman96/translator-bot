# translator-telegram-bot

The code in bot.py is a telegram bot that can help you with inline (and not) translations!
>This python code use [googletrans](https://pypi.org/project/googletrans/) module to translate sentences.

>I also used [telebot](https://github.com/eternnoir/pyTelegramBotAPI) and [long polling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Push_technology#Long_polling) methods.

The code in bot2.py is the same bot but i have added a [text-to-speach](https://gtts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/module.html#) module that asks to google to read a text message for you. Instead of replying with a dot, try to replay with a "#" followed by the source language code.
